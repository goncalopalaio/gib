Original Gameboy (DMG) emulator written in Rust, also featuring several tools
for ROM debugging and development.

**NOTE**: This is still a WIP, no ROM playable yet.

## Building the project

After installing Rust (you can use [rustup](https://rustup.rs) for that), run:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:plorefice/gb-rs
cd gb-rs/
cargo +nightly build --release
```

Only `nightly` versions of Rust are supported right now.

## Running the emulator

Once you have a ROM file, you can use:

```shell
cargo +nightly run --release [rom-file]
```

where the optional `[rom-file]` argument can be used to load a ROM directly from
the command line. Alternatively, you can use the in-app menus.

## Running tests

Currently, unit tests exist for opcode size and timings, along with some peripherals.
In the future, more complete tests will be developed. Some golden tests are also
included to test against known working test ROMs (eg. blargg's).

You can run the test suite with:

```shell
cargo +nightly test --release
```

## Features

The emulator is still a long way from being complete. The current status and roadmap
are shown below.

### Progress

The passing tests are also integrated in the emulator's test suite.

| Test ROM       | Progress | Notes                        |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| cpu_instrs     | 100%     | Full pass!                   |
| instr_timing   | 100%     | **Broken on latest release** |
| interrupt_time | -        | Not tested yet               |
| mem_timing-2   | -        | Not tested yet               |
| mem_timing     | -        | Not tested yet               |
| halt_bug       | -        | Not tested yet               |
| oam_bug        | -        | Not tested yet               |
| dmg_sound      | -        | Not tested yet               |
